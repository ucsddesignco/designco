    a1: "I’ve been on board since my freshman year, and seeing how much it’s grown – from the friendships I’ve fostered with my co-board members to the variety of events that our community has enjoyed – has been so rewarding to watch. I am eternally grateful to be a part of this community, and I can’t wait to see how much more DCo will grow as we pass the baton to other students.",
    q2: 'How have you grown during your time on the Design Co board?',
    a2: "I’m the type of person who needs to have everything in my life planned out. I knew I wanted to get more immersed in design, so joining board was always part of my plan. When I applied for the Media Coordinator position, I was rejected – but to my surprise, I was accepted as a Social Media Coordinator. This role opened other opportunities in marketing for me, like spearheading marketing campaigns for Thurgood Marshall College. My most profound growth, however, came from embracing change. Immersed in an environment of people with a wider array of interests and witnessing the resilience of my co-board members despite the lemons life throws at them, has been a constant source of inspiration for me. Life doesn’t always work out as planned–but that’s the fun in it.",

At first, I simply felt like I wasn’t an experienced designer compared to everyone else to even apply. But, after taking a leap of faith, I’ve been able to meet so many kind, wonderful, and fun individuals from board and others connected to the org.
